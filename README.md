I am a graduate from the University of Edinburgh with a BEng in electrical and electronics engineering currently pursuing a master's degree in electrical and computer engineering at UCLA. I am interested in machine learning and signal processing and I have experience in applying those algorithms in embedded devices.

I have always been fascinated by the use of science to build the tools that facilitate our daily lives. After years of studying and working I have obtained the technical, business and research know-how to be able to turn ideas into reality. This can be seen through the development of a working prototype for sound direction of arrival estimation and of the smart camera that optimizes biomass production in aquacultures.

As an active learner I am trying to pick up on new projects to cultivate my skills and put my abilities to the test. This mindset has led me across multiple educational experiences around the globe such as school in Greece, undergraduate in the UK, a year abroad in the US and a competition in the UAE. Throughout these programs I have collaborated with amazing people of various disciplines and backgrounds from all around the world allowing me to develop a diverse perspective that I could provide to any group that I join.
